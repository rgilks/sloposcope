# Sloposcope - Advanced AI Text Analysis

A comprehensive, production-ready tool for detecting AI-generated text patterns and measuring "slop" across multiple dimensions using state-of-the-art transformer models and semantic analysis.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Advanced NLP Pipeline**: Transformer-based spaCy models (`en_core_web_trf`) with semantic embeddings
- **📊 Multi-dimensional Analysis**: 11 sophisticated metrics including semantic density, coherence, and conceptual analysis
- **🎯 Domain-Specific Scoring**: Configurable weighting for news, Q&A, and general content
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized for production with <1s processing for 1k words
- **🌐 Modern Web Interface**: Real-time analysis with beautiful, responsive UI
- **🔌 REST API**: Full API for seamless integration with other applications
- **☁️ Cloud Ready**: Docker deployment with AWS ECS/SQS worker support
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally, no external API calls

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

curl -X POST "https://sloposcope.fly.dev/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Your text here",
    "domain": "general",
    "explain": true,
    "spans": true
  }'
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl "https://sloposcope.fly.dev/health"
```

### Get Metrics Info

```bash
curl "https://sloposcope.fly.dev/metrics"
```

## 🔍 Analysis Metrics

The tool analyzes text across 11 sophisticated dimensions:

### Information Utility

1. **Density** - Semantic density, perplexity, and conceptual complexity
2. **Relevance** - Semantic similarity to prompts and reference materials

### Information Quality

3. **Factuality** - Claim verification and factual accuracy assessment
4. **Subjectivity** - Bias detection and subjectivity analysis

### Style Quality

5. **Coherence** - Entity continuity and semantic drift detection
6. **Repetition** - N-gram repetition and compression analysis
7. **Verbosity** - Wordiness and structural complexity
8. **Templated** - Boilerplate phrases and template detection
9. **Tone** - Hedging, sycophancy, and tone analysis
10. **Fluency** - Grammar and fluency assessment
11. **Complexity** - Lexical and syntactic complexity

## 📈 Slop Levels

- **🟢 Clean** (≤ 0.30): High-quality, human-like text
- **🟡 Watch** (0.30 - 0.55): Some AI patterns detected
- **🟠 Sloppy** (0.55 - 0.75): Clear AI-generated characteristics
- **🔴 High-Slop** (> 0.75): Obvious AI-generated content

## 🎯 Domains

The analysis can be customized for different content types:

- **General**: General purpose text analysis
- **News**: News articles and journalism
- **Q&A**: Question and answer content
