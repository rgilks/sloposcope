I went to the store yesterday. It was raining hard, so I got soaked walking there. The store was crowded with people buying groceries. I picked up some milk, bread, and eggs. The cashier was friendly and asked how my day was going. I told her it was okay, just wet from the rain. She laughed and said she hoped it would stop soon. I paid with cash and walked home. The rain had stopped by then, which was nice. I made a sandwich when I got home and watched TV for a while. It was a pretty normal day.
