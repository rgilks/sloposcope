# Sloposcope Development History & Achievements

## üéØ Project Overview

Sloposcope is an AI slop detection system that identifies low-quality, verbose, or stylistically padded text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The project has evolved through multiple phases based on research findings and practical testing.

## üìö Research Foundation

Based on "Measuring AI 'SLOP' in Text" (Shaib et al., 2025), the project implements detection across 7 core dimensions:

1. **Density** - Information content per word
2. **Relevance** - Appropriateness to context/task
3. **Factuality** - Accuracy and truthfulness
4. **Bias** - One-sided or over-generalized claims
5. **Structure** - Templated and repetitive patterns
6. **Coherence** - Logical flow and organization
7. **Tone** - Context-appropriate voice and style

- Improve pattern detection accuracy

## üìù Key Learnings

### What Worked

- **Research-Based Approach**: Following academic research led to better results
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Single metrics were insufficient
- **Natural Writing Protection**: Critical for preventing false positives
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and caching essential for production

### What Didn't Work

- **Pattern-Only Approaches**: Over-reliance on regex patterns
- **Single-Metric Focus**: Individual features insufficient alone
- **Aggressive Thresholds**: Led to false positives on natural writing
- **BERT Integration**: Complex training requirements for limited benefit

## üéØ Current Status

**Production Ready** ‚úÖ - The research-compliant slop detector is stable, well-tested, and ready for production deployment. It successfully identifies slop while protecting natural human writing from false positives.

**Next Priority**: Fix coherence analysis implementation and add remaining research dimensions for even better accuracy.
